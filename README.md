## My process

### Built with

-
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

In this project I tried to create logical React components.Such as the round Total Result summary score and Summary pane.

I found it challenging to overlap the two main sections but found use of absolute and relative positions useful here.
